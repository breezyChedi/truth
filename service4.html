            mines. This is why the diamond museum in Tel Aviv, Israel is named after Nicky Oppenheimer, founder of De
            Beers, because he made sure that the Africa's land and people were exploited for the benefit of Israel's
            economy and his descendants maintain the status qou. The corrupted merchants and multinationals of the world
            are well aware which land is special. </p>

                Paternal and maternal haplogroups are genetic markers
                that reveal your paternal and maternal lineages <img src="e1b1a.png" alt="Description of Image 1"
                    class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw">
                respectively. The different haplogroups correspond to
                different gene pools of different ancestors, when group of
                people diverge into different directions and environments,
                that is when the haplogroups form “subclades” and mutate
                differently (single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation).
                The “Bantu” people are primarily of haplogroup E,
                specifically E1B1A, this represents a divergence from
                E1B1B which is found in north Africa, the Mediterranean
                and in high proportions among jewish communities in
                Europe. In contrast, the KhoiKhoi, San, Pygmies and
                related groups carry the paternal haplogroups A and B
                which are exclusive to Africa, the historical range of these
                haplogroups used to stretch from the Western Cape as far
                north as Sudan/Ethiopia and we know this because their
                descendants are still in these regions and their genes are
                present in many “Bantu” people today due to their clans
                assimilating. Paternal haplogroups A, B are distinct from E,
                that is why the Khoi differ from the “Bantu”.
                Western academics (foreigners studying our story) claim that
                there was a “Bantu expansion” they try to push the narrative
                that those with E1B1A appeared somewhere in central
                Africa out of nowhere and then their population exploded
                significantly. There is no evidence to justify this whatsoever, this theory is not justified by oral
                history, archaeology or genetics but rather a desire to maintain the false narrative that North Africa
                is
                and always has been distinct from "sub-saharan" Africa.
                They do not study the
                archaeology from Sudan to South Africa because they
                assume theres no story there and the conflict in the region continues to erase the history of the people
                there. The victors write his story, we must know our story.

                Scripture will tell you that the Hebrews left Egypt and
                entered the land of Canaan. Scripture also tells you that
                Canaan was a son of Ham and few people dispute that the
                Hamites are African people. The Book of Jubilees (excluded
                from roman descended bibles) describes very explicitly the
                allocation of land to the different descendants of Noah
                (Shem, Ham, Japheth) and allocates Africa to the sons of
                Ham. When Noah allocated land to his 3 sons he was doing
                so not only to his sons but also their descendants since you
                inherit land from your parents.
                The Hebrews after leaving Egypt enter the land of Canaan,
                the Canaanites are the Khoi and their related groups, this is
                where the derogatory term “Hottentot” comes from because
                the Hebrew/semitic scripts do not have vowels and
                Hottentot is simply Hitite with dutch phonetics, the Hitites
                are described as part of the Canaanites in scripture. The
                dutch and the huguenots knew whose land they were in,
                this is why they named many places in the country after
                locations in the bible.

                This is also why during the “great” trek some of the boers
                known as the “Jerusalemgangers” split off towards Namibia
                because they believed that Jerusalem was not that far from
                them and that they were the chosen Israelites.

                If you ask the fake jews what are the genetic markers for
                the Canaanites or the Hebrews they will not be able to tell
                you in a way that makes sense, that is because they are
                lying.

            <p> 6. Geological context of scripture, The real red sea
                There used to be a large
                <img src="oldrivers.png" alt="" class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw">
                lake in the region of Sudan,
                north of whats currently
                called the “Darfur” region,
                some people will try to
                convince you that this was
                6000 years ago, the time
                when the entire Sahara was
                green but proper
                investigation will show it
                was relatively recent, so
                recent that the Greco
                Romans were even around
                to rename the lake to distort the history, they called it “Lake
                Ptolemy” and described it as a marsh i.e “sea of reeds”. In
                South Sudan there is currently an impassable marsh called
                “Al-Sudd” so we can deduce that the region between Al
                Sudd and Lake Ptolemy was a marshy terrain when the
                region was greener. This is the region that the Hebrews
                crossed with Moses, this is why in Zephaniah 3:10 it says
                “From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshippers, my
                scattered people, will bring me offerings”.
                Lake Chad located in North Eastern Nigeria, South Western
                Chad, used to be much larger as well indicating that the
                entire Sahel region was much greener than it is today, Lake
                Chad and Ptolemy likely had river/s connecting each other
                which is also consistent with the oldest maps in the world
                that used to consider the Niger river as an extension of the
                Nile river and you can see on google maps that there are
                still settlements between these lakes that are built along
                where the old rivers used to flow.
                This region also correspond to the true river Euphrates
                (most likely yellow nile) which is why it has been drying up
                as prophesied. This is also why the archaeological site
                located in the region has the Arabic name “Ain Farah” when
                there is a location in the fake Israel of the same name
                which they renamed as “En Prat” which is Hebrew for
                Euphrates. The archaeological site demonstrates the
                presence of what they label “Christian Nubian”(True Israeli)
                pottery. This region is significant in the Book of Ezra
                documenting the history of Israel and the fall of Jerusalem
                where it is described in English translations as the “Trans
                euphrates”.<br><br>
                9. The deceptions and the true story.

                Nguni=Ngoni this is why there are people as far north as
                Tanzania/Zambia whose ancestors are from South Africa
                and they identify as “Ngoni”. Goni is listed as a descendant
                of Naphtali in Gen 46:24, one of the tribes of Israel, this is
                likely why the Portuguese named KZN Natalia and also
                corresponds to Umtali and Makoni in Zimbabwe as well as
                the Naletale archaeological monument.
                Batswana, Basotho, Bapedi, Bakalanga:
                These differentiations are relatively recent, for example the
                Basotho identity was created by King Moshoeshoe in
                response to Boer and Zulu expansion, “Sotho” just comes
                from “Soot” which is an old European word for black similar
                to “Swarthy” which is where “Swati” come from (AmaSwati
                are mostly from AmaMbo/Embo and there are groups in
                Cameroon who call themselves by the same name).
                The totems corresponding to the clans tell a truer story and
                are evidence that all these people are related, and many
                clans moved into South Africa, Botswana and Zambia after
                the decline of “Great Zimbabwe” which was a kingdom
                consisting of many related groups and dynasties, the
                “Shona” identity did not exist 100 years ago, prior to this
                they identified themselves by clans and are closely related
                to the Bakalanga, the Bakalanga are all related to the
                Bapedi/Batswana etc, they are simply the descendants that
                remained in Zimbabwe which is why they are credited with
                the construction of the various stone structures.
                
                <img src="umqhele.png" alt="" class="float-right" style="max-width:25vw"> Balozi/
                Barotse in Zambia and Bahurutshe are descended from
                what is recorded as the “Rozwi” dynasty of great Zimbabwe
                The “Torwa” dynasty is also recorded as ruling Great
                Zimbabwe at one period and are related to the “Tora”
                dynasty of Darfur (DarDaju) this is also a likely etymology of
                the “Torah”/“Taurat” of the jewish and islamic religions. Daura, hausa
                The have created arbitrary classifications of languages and
                ethnicities to distort the truth. They created categories such
                as “nubian”, “nilotic” and “bantu” ignoring the beliefs, culture
                and history of all these people, they divide us as much as
                possible and then label us as tribalistic, once we start
                writing our own history these deceptions will be undone. This was done to separate our stories and disconnect the Nile its source.
                They do not want us to know the true story, thats why they
                f
                looded various kushite/nubian temples by creating the
                Aswan dam of Egypt, and in doing so the UN was able to
                create the World Heritage Convention as a “solution” and
                justify relocating (probably tainting) the various
                archaeological sites.
                In the current historiography written by victors they say that
                there was the “New Kingdom Of Egypt” - where the
                “Kushite” dynasties had control of the entirety of Sudan and
                the whole of Egypt.
                <img src="taharqa.jpg" alt="" class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw">
                Then after this you have the “Kingdom of Kush” when their
                territory was reduced to upper Egypt and south of that. It is
                at this point in historiography where they begin to
                whitewash Egypts history, because they treat the
                succeeding foreign lower Egypt dynasties as Egyptian but
                the Kushites(native) as foreign, so now due to strategically
                tainted history people associate Cleopatra who was a greek
                woman with the Egyptians.
                The difference between the “New Kingdom of Egypt” and
                “Kingdom of Kush” is arbitrary, they justify it by the fact that
                their borders were reduced to upper Egypt and Sudan.
                Then after the “Kingdom of Kush” you have “Christian
                Nubia” which supposedly had 3 christian states of Alodia,
                Makuria, Nobatia located in upper Egypt/Sudan for nearly
                1000 years and they supposedly had the longest treaty with
                the Islamic world known as the “Baqt” for 700 years.
                The difference between “Kush” and “Christian Nubia” is also
                arbitrary and when you research the “conversion” to
                christianity they will make it seem like the “pagan” temples
                were converted to “christian” temples even though the
                structures themselves never changed. This is why they can
                not explain where the descendants of “Christian Nubia”
                went, their historiography got altered as they got conquered
                by foreign powers, Roman Egypt, Funj Sultanate, Kingdom
                of Aksum etc. The Kingdom of Aksum, although located in
                Ethiopia, their ruling class at that time used greek indicating
                that they were actually foreigners this is why in the current
                Ethiopian narrative their 1st king who was a descendant of
                Solomon conquered Ethiopia to remove the evil Zagwe
                dynasty, only after the fall of Aksum is the Ethiopian Empire
                established. The Jewish community there known as “Beta
                Israel” claim to be descendants of Dan, this is because
                north of Ethiopia is Butana, which fake history will say was
                a part of Christian Nubia.
                <img src="nubiamap.png" alt="" class="float-right" style="max-width:25vw">
                “Ethiopia” it self is a greek word
                that at one stage referred to the whole of Africa.
                The reason why the Greco-romans distorted our
                understanding of Egypt was to make it seem like the
                knowledge of god and Jesus was brought by them,
                because if we understood who the earliest Christians were,
                we would have a better understanding of the truth. Africa
                has always been the source.
                The true story:
                The New Kingdom of Egypt represents both Kush and
                Israel, because they were often on the same side and they
                were conquered by the same enemies, thats why many of
                the “Bantu” are descendants of both Kushites and
                Israelites. After the fall of Egypt, Kush, and the northern
                kingdom of Israel, they create the “New Kingdom of Egypt”
                in their historiography to confuse people with what
                happened, of course this is preceded by widespread
                destruction and looting of the sites which they continued to
                do during the colonial era.
                A true jew is someone who follows the true god and lives
                righteously, judaism is a constructed religion and identity.<br><br>

                Taharqa of the Kushite 25th dynasty is described in Isaiah
                37:9 and 2 kings 19:9 as going to fight the king of Assyria
                who was threatening Israel, Israel in scripture is often
                accused of being too dependent on Egypt, this is why in
                2 Kings 18:21, the king of Assyria says:
                “Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered
                reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans
                on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on
                him”
                Similarly in Isaiah 20:5 and in Isaiah 30:1-2 a prophet tells
                Israel that they were being too dependent on Egypt rather
                than the Lord a common theme in the old testament.
                Now that we know the correct geography of Israel this make
                a lot of sense. It would not make much sense if Israel was
                located in the middle east because then they would be
                adjacent to Assyria, the scripture very clearly describes
                Egypt and Kush as a buffer. This is why in Isaiah 43:3 it
                says:
                “For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your
                Savior; I give Egypt for your ransom, Cush and Sheba in
                your stead.”
                Kush is close to Israel, Numbers 12:1 even tells us that
                Moses married a kushite and in Amos 9:7 describing events
                closer to the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel, it says:
                “Are not you Israelites the same to me as the Cushites?”
                declares the LORD.
                There are leaders of the “New Kingdom of Egypt” named
                “Thutmose I”, “Thutmose II”, “Thutmose III” . It is possible
                that these reference the same person because the foreign
                conquerors wanted to lengthen their historiography. What is
                important to understand is “Thutmose” = “Ntate Moshi” . All
                of these leaders are named after Moses, “Thut” = “Ntate”
                which means “Father”, The word “Dad” is derived from this.
                This is why in Sepedi and related languages “Mose” means
                smoke, it corresponds to the location “Moshi” located in
                Tanzania by Mt Kilimanjaro because that is where Moses/
                Moshi went up to speak to god and scripture tells us of how
                there was so much smoke that the Israelites were scared to
                go up hence why his name is associated with smoke.
                This is why they created “Egyptology” they turned a culture
                and the artefacts of the culture into a science for their
                foreign conquerors so that they could come up with their
                own false understanding and theories completely tainted by
                their biases and false history.

                <img src="darfurlake.png" alt="" class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw">
                The region between sub-saharan Africa and the Sahara
                desert is called the “Sahel” region, “Sahel” is an old Arabic
                word meaning “Shore”/“Coast” this might seem mysterious
                until you know the true historical context, the “Sea of
                Reeds” was approximately where Lake Ptolemy was and
                Lake Chad was much larger, hence why they referred to the
                region during their expansion into North Africa in this
                manner.
                The Darfur region in South Sudan is called “Darfur”
                because that means “Home of the fur people”, before it was
                called Darfur it was called “Dardaju” = “Home of daju” i.e
                “Home of the jew”. There are significant archaeological
                sites in the region that the people there say was built by a
                previous group of people (the original inhabitants were
                displaced by islamic/arabic expansion). Wikipedia will tell you there are
                palaces 200m - 400m in width, they describe the
                architecture as “Stone huts” and “distinctly african”.
                Unfortunately, due to the powers that be, there has been conflict in the region for centuries and so
                archaeologist have
                not been able to further investigate, this is by design, they do not want us to know the truth.

                There is a terrorist group operating in the region called
                Rapid Support Forces they were perpetrators of the Darfur
                genocide, on their original logo before they changed it
                recently (few months before the beginning of the Israeli
                conflict)
                <img src="quds.png" alt="" class="float-right" style="max-width:25vw">, they had “Al Quds” which is Arabic for Jerusalem
                which implies they are fighting in Jerusalem, however they
                are only present in Darfur(previously called DarDaju). This is why prior to the logo
                change they referred to Hamas as a terrorist movement, it
                is because they believe they are fighting in the true Holy land.

                These are the genetic haplogroups corresponding to the
                groups in North Africa who today are islamic and historically
                managed the Trans-Saharan slave trade. I put this here to
                show that Islam is a foreign religion and was brought to
                Africa to oppress her people, by rewarding those who
                exploit it. This is done by commodifying women and using them to incentivise men to maintain the order.

                so
                that the “best” men (who know their version of the Quran
                the best, rich slave trader ) have the most wives and this incentivises the
                men on the top to maintain the societal structure similar to
                the bank-driven capitalist order</p>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Israelite Culture and Traditions</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>3. Israelite traditions
                If you read the scriptures it will become clear that the
                Hebrews value their land which they farm and they value
                their livestock, academics would call this Agro-Pastoralism,
                and what a “coincidence” most “Bantu” cultures practice
                Agro-Pastoralism. Pork historically was never consumed by
                the “Bantu” people and the “Bantu” people also practice
                circumcision throughout the continent. The Hebrews are
                also described as ritually slaughtering animals as sacrificial
                offerings. Many africans have known their god and had
                various name to describe the creator long before religion
                was brought here.
                <img src="pap.png" alt="" class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw">
                My favourite is what they translate as “unleavened bread” in
                the English bible as it is very significant to Hebrew culture
                and is mentioned throughout the bible and the jews are
                supposed to celebrate the “festival of unleavened bread”
                Unleavened bread is bread made without yeast.
                Deuteronomy 16:3: “Do not eat it with bread made with
                yeast, but for seven days eat unleavened bread, the bread
                of affliction, because you left Egypt in haste—so that all the
                days of your life you may remember the time of your
                departure from Egypt”.
                The hebrews were leaving Egypt in a rush there was no
                time to bake bread and wait for the yeast to rise.
                The primary ingredients of leavened bread is yeast and
                grain plants such as wheat/maize, bread is typically
                associated with wheat but that is not necessarily true. I n
                Upper Egypt they eat a bread called “Eish merahrah” made
                from maize, wikipedia will tell you “It is part of the traditional
                diet of the Egyptian countryside, prepared locally in village
                homes in Upper Egypt”. So what would “unleavened bread”
                i.e bread without yeast look like?
                Exodus 12:18:
                “And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and
                unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.”

                Followers of Judaism use what they call a “shofar” which is
                a Kudu horn, there are no kudus in the middle east. The
                Kudu is an African animal.
                Are vuvuzelas also from the
                fake israel? Let’s not be stupid.
                The deception has been going
                on for too long.

                4. Jewish culture
                If you read exodus and the books documenting Israel and
                Judah, you will see that they follow what we would now call
                a clan-based society. They often name the clans after the
                founder of the clan, alliances with other groups often start
       
        with marriages between royalty because then the clans
                become merged and intermarriage becomes common. A
                clan is a society that is viewed as an extension of your
                family, <img src="vuvuzela.png" alt="2" class="float-right" style="max-width:25vw"> political ideologies such as nationalism and fascism
                are just the result of political leaders trying to construct new
                clans i.e a nation. The international merchants hate such
                systems and push for individualism because if we truly
                viewed our society as an extension of our family we would
                never allow it to degrade and we would see our neighbours
                as distant family, A big family willing to help each other in
                times of need does not need loans from a bank, does not
                need to beg on the street, and does not need to tolerate a
                working environment where they are disrespected and
                undervalued, the merchants can’t profit off of a big family,
                this is why they destroy all such societies.

                2. what is a “jew”?
                <img src="sardinia1.png" alt="5" class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw">

                Jew is an english word, it has the same etymology as
                judiciary and judicates, the reason is because if you were
                close to god and an honest leader you were also a just
                judge. Historically these roles were often one and the same
                in just societies, hence why many African traditional
                societies are led by the equivalent of priests. Since my
                enemies will accuse me of being “afro-centric” I will use the
                island of Sardinia located in the Mediterranean Sea near
                Italy and France as evidence. Sardinia had historically
                resisted Vatican/Roman domination and the kingdom was
                divided into 4 “Judicates” (The equivalent of provinces)
                ruled by 4 “Judges”. This is their flag and the coat of arms
                which it is derived from. It all makes sense, these things are
                not random, the words we use are not random.
                <img src="sardinia2.png" alt="6" class="float-right" style="max-width:25vw"> The
                deception can not continue any longer.
                This is why in the Book of Revelations 3:1 it says “To the
                angel of the church in Sardis”

                8. The architecture and archaeology of Judah and Israel
                Dry Stone Masonry
                Dry stone masonry is
                a technique where
                stones are stacked
                and fitted together
                without the use of
                mortar or other
                bonding agents.
                Instead, the structure
                relies on the precise
                placement of stones
                to create a stable and
                durable construction. Dry stone masonry requires far more
                skill than brick and mortar and has been used for centuries.
                This is a technique we find all over Africa and it is what links
                the history.<img src="zim.png" alt="" class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw"> In Southern Africa theres the Bokoni settlements
                in Mpumalanga, and various sites in the region such as the
                Khami and Dzata ruins, and the well known Great
                Zimbabwe. “Zimbabwe” just means “House of Stones” a
                reference to the numerous archaeological sites in the
                region. This same architecture can be found as far north as
                Cameroon where theres the Diy-Gid-Biy site and most
                importantly in Sudan and Nubia where it is associated with
                the “mysterious” so called Daju people and the “Tora” which
                is obviously related to the “Torwa” dynasty associated with
                Great Zimbabwe ;taurat;, the truth can not
                be suppressed.
