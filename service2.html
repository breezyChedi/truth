        <p>What kind of land would the creator of all things give to his chosen people? Israel controls and profits from
            the diamond trade yet have no diamond mines. This is why the diamond museum in Tel Aviv, Israel is named
            after Nicky Oppenheimer, founder of De Beers, because he made sure that the Africa's land and people were
            exploited for the benefit of Israel's economy and his descendants maintain the status qou. The corrupted
            merchants and multinationals of the world are well aware which land is special. </p>

                The land of Canaan is the land that the Israelites moved
                into after leaving Egypt. Its vey clear that The plants and animals described in the bible belong to
                African land inconsistent with desert of palestine currently occupied by fake jews.

                The scripture says that the Israelites the land that the descendants of Canaan lived in, Canaan was a
                son of Ham/Cham/Kemet/Kemi

                Judah’s totem is a lion which has been appropriated by
                European royal dynasties since the fall of Israel. This is why
                there is a greek letter of a cross called “Tau” which means
                lion in Sepedi and related languages because the Koine
                Greek script itself was made in Alexandria, Egypt and their
                writing systems are based on the truth that has been
                manipulated. This is why one of the kings of the “New
                Kingdom of Egypt” is called “Seqenenre Tao”
                The letter “q” is an invention, t
                the heiroglyphs
                <br><br>
                The letter “J” itself is a recent invention to distort the truth,
                the etymology of Judah and Cheetah/Chitau are the same
                because the so called “New Kingdom of Egypt” had tamed
                cheetahs. This also explains why the latin academic term
                for a cheetah is “Acinonyx jubatus”
                <br><br>
                <img src="bee.png" alt="" class="float-right" style="max-width:25vw;border-radius: 0px;">
                The land of Canaan is described as being a land flowing
                with “milk and honey” in Exodus 3:8t.
                This is the range of the African honeybees:
                Wikipedia will tell you:
                “In terms of industrial honey
                production, in its natural habitat and
                the neo-tropics, the African bee
                produces far more honey than its
                European counterparts. It is unclear
                if this is due to a superior nectar
                gathering ability, lack of adaptability
                in the European honey bees for
                tropical environment, or both”
                <br><br>
                Arguably
                the best cattle, the “Sanga Cattle”
                and associated breeds are found in
                the
                same region. This is why
                Americans imported the cattle
                decades ago and set up a breeding society to create their
                modern “Ankole-Watusi” one of which holds the record for
                the largest horns of any cattle.
                <br><br>
                lions, leopards, rhinoceros(which is a unicorn) all mentioned
                in scripture, then they will say there used to be all these
                animals in the fake Israel and somehow they magically
                disappeared, the same way the entire jewish nation
                magically disappeared from Palestine, then they will use the
                US/De Beers/Merchant funded wealth to try to convince you
                <br><br>
                that their land is blessed, they tried “reintroducing” ostriches
                there but surprise surprise the population could not survive
                in a random desert.
                Where are the giraffes? Roman bibles had to translate
                giraffe as “Camelopardalis” this is why in Afrikaans they still
                say “kameelperd” as giraffe.
                <br><br>
                The Sycamore Fig Trees which have biblical significance is
                found all over Africa, and is known as “mugumo” by the
                Kikuyu who still associate it closely with the true god and
                their culture.
                <img src="acacia-rs.jpg" alt="" class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw">
                Acacia trees are mentioned throughout the bible. These are
                acacia trees, they want you to believe these are somehow
                associated with the fake israel.

                Moses did not cross a red sea, he went though a "Sea of reeds" i.e a marsh. This was approximately what
                the greeks remamed "Lake Ptolemy"[] in NOrthwest Sudan.

                . Moab
                This corresponds to the land of the “Moabites” described in
                scripture theres are still descendants there that identify as
                “Mzab” and they are associated with the archaeology of the
                area. Their range was larger before the arab/islamic
                expansion into Africa and Deuteronomy 2:29, 2:9 associate
                them with Ar(5) the Israelites are described as having
                passed them.
                <br><br>
                2. Jericho
                Multiple places in this region of kenya named after the
                original Jericho. Kerio Valley, Kericho etc . This is why
                theres significant archaeological sites in this region called
                Sirikwa.
                <br><br>
                3. Negev
                The Negev refers to the region associated with the Niger
                River which is what Niger and Nigeria are named after and
                this is why the French/latin pronunciation of Niger is nearly
                identical to Negev.
                <br><br>
                4. Soko/Sokoh
                Soko corresponds to Sokoto located in Northern Nigeria
                that the Sokoto caliphate was also named after.
                <br><br>
                5. Ar
                Ar are the Aïr mountains located in Niger
                <br><br>
                6. Damascus
                In North Eastern Nigeria is the region of Damasak that has
                old archaeological sites, this also corresponds to the
                Tuareg people who identify as “Tamasheq”.
                <br><br>
                7. Benjamin
                The city of N’Djamena in Chad is named after Benjamin
                and his tribe. Additionally the region of “Gilead” mentioned
                in scripture likely corresponds to what we now call “Chad”.
                Kadesh-Barnea is probably equivalent to Kanem-Bornu
                which was north of here
                <br><br>
                8. Marah
                Exodus says that Moses and the Israelites passed through
                Marah after leaving Egypt, this is the Marrah mountains
                located in Sudan.
                <br><br>
                9. Dan
                The Butana region is named after Dan=Tana and his tribe,
                this is why the jewish community in Ethiopia claim descent
                from the tribe of Dan, which is also evidenced by Eldad ha
                Dani from the 9th century. They moved south into Ethiopia
                after the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel, this is why
                the lake in Ethiopia where they are situated by is called
                Lake Tana. This is also why the other name for Butana
                cattle is Kenana cattle, kenana=Canaan, the land that
                Israelites moved into. The neighbouring Amhara or Oromo
                likely correspond to the Amorites.
                <br><br>
                10. Shiloh
                Shiloh is often described as where Israelites congregate,
                this makes sense considering it is situated close to the
                northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of
                Judah. This is why there was the Shilluk kingdom located
                there, and in their oral history they record that their king
                Nyikang split off from Duwadh=David who was based south
                of them close to the great lakes region.
                <br><br>
                11. Lebanon
                The scriptural Lebanon refers to a region in the forests of
                the DRC, this is why throughout scripture it talks about the
                “Cedars of Lebanon” and this is why the fake Lebanon has
                a tree on their flag. The DRC literally has a rainforest while
                Lebanon is mostly desert, let’s not be stupid. This is what
                the Luba Kingdom that was located there was named after.
                The bible actually prophecies this deception in Ezekiel 17
                Heres an extract:
                “And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
                Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the
                house of Israel;
                And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with
                great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers
                colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest
                branch of the cedar:
                He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into
                a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.”
                The fake Lebanon historically during Israels time, especially
                the city of Tyre, has been a land of merchants
                corresponding to the Phoenicians who established a
                maritime empire all around the mediterranean and after
                being a part of the manipulation of writing systems and truth
                they relocated to Italy and became the Venetians.
                <br><br>
                12. Horeb
                The mountain that Moses went up to speak to god when
                there was so much smoke that the Israelites were scared,
                was Mt Kilimanjaro this is why there is a town there called
                “Moshi” and is also why “Moshi” means smoke in many
                Israelite languages.
                <br><br>
                13. Esau/Edom
                Esau is described as the founder of the Edomites. This
                corresponds to the Sao Civilisation that was located around
                lake chad who later became the Hausa that mostly adopted
                Islam, the Hausa are the largest non-arabic ethnicity in
                Africa due to the divisions of the other ethnicities. Theres
                groups in western Nigeria who identify as “Idoma” and
                “Edo” and who had the Edo kingdom. They also might be
                related to the Ibom Kingdom. In the oral history of the
                Hausa they document how their founder came from Egypt
                this is consistent with scripture since Esau and the
                Edomites are described as relatives of the Israelites.
                <br><br>
                14. DarDaju
                This was essentially the “frontline” of Israel, whether or not
                Jerusalem refers to a specific town rather than a region is
                debatable, but the main city of Jerusalem was likely here. If
                not Jerusalem then the northern kingdom of Israels capital
                recorded as Samaria was here. There is very significant
                archaeological sites here that have been damaged and
                looted for centuries and people are unable to further
                investigate due to the ongoing conflict in Darfur. Darfur was
                previously called DarDaju which means “home of the jew”,
                this is the name applied by the foreign conquerors before
                they put more effort into changing the story.
                <br><br>
                15. Portugese “Judah”
                This was a major source of slaves for the Portugese, this is
                why they called it “Juda” because they knew where the
                slaves were coming from.
                One of their historians who converted from Islam to
                Christianity and changed his name from “al-Hasan
                Muhammad al-Wazzan al-Fasi” to “Johannes Leo
                Africanus”. ( who was likely instrumental in forging
                Portugese history) claimed that the jews were south of
                Egypt, heres an excerpt from the wikipedia detailing the
                history of the term “Kaffir”:
                “The 16th century explorer Leo Africanus described
                the Cafri as non-Islamic “negroes” and one of five principal
                population groups in Africa. According to him, they were "as
                blacke as pitch, and of a mightie stature, and (as some
                thinke) descended of the Jews; but now they are idolators."
                Leo Africanus identified the Cafri's geographical heartland
                as being located in remote southern Africa, an area which
                he designated as Cafraria.”
                I hope you see the game they’ve been playing. Switch
                religions, create new religions, change names, change the
                narrative, use the same words, target the same people.
                <br><br>
                16. Gad
                The tribe of gad was located in this region, Eri is listed as a
                son of gad in Genesis 46:16 who was the founder of the
                Igbo people, another son of Gad is recorded as Arodi
                whose descendants likely formed the Arochukwu .
                <br><br>
                17. Gilgal

                This corresponds to Gilgil located in Kenya.
                <br><br>18. Ophir
                Ophir is described as the location of Solomons gold mines
                corresponding to the gold mines of Great Zimbabwe,
                Souphír is recorded as another variant of the name which
                corresponds to port of Sofala located on the coast of
                Mozambique. Vasco de Gama’s companion Tome Lopes
                reasoned that Ophir would have been the ancient name
                for Great Zimbabwe, the main center of southern
                african trade in gold. Even the Portuguese believed this
                hence why they made sure to take control of the trade
                routes from the Arabs and then collapse the state that was
                based there by funding warlords known as Prazos with
                slave armies and aiding anyone within Zimbabwe who
                wanted to overthrow the ruling dynasties.
                <br><br>
                19. Simeon

                Simeon is described as one of the tribes of Israel this
                corresponds to the kingdom of Simien that was located in
                Ethiopia. The Book of Judith/Gudit is scripture that takes
                place here.
                <br><br>
                20. Sheba

                Queen Sheba, her state and associated descendants were
                on both sides of the Arabian Sea (Red Sea). They
                disconnect it in their historiography of the region, so you
                have the mysterious “D’mt” culture located in Ethiopia the
                Jewish Himyarite kingdom in Yemen and the “Sabaens”
                these all correspond to the same entity, this is why their
                kingdom is described in scripture as having control of a lot
                of trade. The Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia claim to be
                descended by the son of Sheba and Solomon
                <br><br>21. Hor

                There is a south Horr and north Horr in Kenya, this region
                corresponds to the scriptural Hor. Hor in Hebrew means mountain.
                <br><br>
                22. Jewish presence

                The Portugese called the coast here “Gulf de Jude” . The
                europeans recorded that there was a jewish community in
                the republic of Congo and Gabon, they’ve tried to make it
                seem like they came all the way from Spain and assimilated
                into the “native” groups so thats why the jews disappeared.
                Meanwhile the Bamileke, Bassa and related groups there
                are well aware of their jewish identity .
                <br><br>
                23. Levites
                The Levites described as the priestly tribe in the bible
                correspond to the Lemba, this is why they are found
                throughout southern Africa, in Kongo, leading slave
                rebellions and in the regions surrounding Zimbabwe and
                have historically had close ties to the royalty of various
                groups, this is proven by their oral narrative and the
                genetics of the Buba clan.
                If you think something in your bible contradicts what Im
                saying you should investigate how the bible has been
                translated and what the Hebrew words represented.
                blueletterbible.com allows you to look at english scripture
                side by side with the Hebrew words and then you can see
                how the corresponding Hebrew words are used in different
                contexts to better understand the original contextual/
                connotational meaning. The current alphabet considered as
                Hebrew is not the original script so there is also an
                additional layer of manipulation, and there are no vowels in
                the script so the vowels are the easiest for them to make
                up.
