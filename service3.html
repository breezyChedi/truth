                Quarrels made them neglect Mohomet’s Law, and revolt from the Caliph of Bagdat, for which they were
                severely punish’d by the Mohometan Caliphs, who caus’d all their Books to be burnt, on Suspicion that
                the knowledge of the Arts and Sciences prompted them to contemn Mohomet’s Law"</i></p>
