                The Egyptian spirtual system and story was about a kingdom of light and darkness, chaos and order and their symbolism reflected this. The eurocentric perspective and rewriting of his-story has mystified the Egyptian beliefs and distorted the afrocentric truth that can be found in the scriptures of the Abrahamic religions.

                Thoth, Thought

                10. Religion is a construct, true christianity is from Egypt
 It is important to understand that the beliefs of the 
Egyptians have been distorted often purposefully and often 
due to bias and so when they can not understand their 
symbolism they will simplify it by describing it as a ‚Äúdeity‚Äù 
and they will say there were all these different ‚ÄúCults‚Äù in 
Egypt, this is the same tactic used during the expansion of 
Islam and Christianity into Africa. 
The different so called ‚Äúdeities‚Äù are often the different ways 
of describing the creator and their attributes that are in us 
and around us. The early christians who were later labelled 
as ‚ÄúHeretics‚Äù use a similar concept of Aeons, one of the 
aeons are called ‚ÄúHoros‚Äù corresponding to the Egyptian 
depiction of Horus. They want people to  view Egypt as a 
source of paganism rather than Greco-Rome, so that they  
can distort and manipulate the christianity that originated in 
Egypt. 
<br><br>
For example, the Egyptians represented mathematics with 
maat, thought with thoth and atom comes from atum. The 
foreign conquerors and subsequent egyptologists will say 
these were all different gods they worshipped and that the 
Egyptians believed that maat was a daughter of thoth. The Eurocentric lens fails to interpret the symbolism of Egypt thus hiding the cultural appropriation that took place.

<br><br>
 We have the temple of Amun in Sudan i.e Amen, this 
influences the names of many kushite/nubian leaders in the 
form of ‚ÄúAmani‚Äù. Unsurprisingly the romans damaged the 
temple. These temples were highly valued in the ‚ÄúNew 
Kingdom of Egypt‚Äù and the dominance of Judah in Egypt 
and the Egyptians worshiping the true god was written in 
Isaiah 19:17-19.
<br><br>
 The Elephantine papyri also demonstrates an early jewish 
presence in Upper Egypt of jews worshipping in Egyptian 
temples who had no knowledge of the written Torah. Most 
of the jews in Egypt became the early christians, the gap 
between the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel and the 
death of Christ has been exaggerated.
 Modern historiography will tell you that before Christianity 
was adopted (created) by the romans the Osiris ‚Äúmyth‚Äù was 
the most common belief throughout the Roman empire. It is 
also worth noting that when Christianity was adopted by the 
romans they created and maintained their own manipulated 
version of it and persecuted other early christians who were 
closer to the truth.
 The Nag Hammadi Library found in upper Egypt 
demonstrates the early christian presence and contains 
many scriptures that were excluded 
The ‚Äúancient‚Äù Egyptians referred to the creator as Osiris 
and Isis, Isis corresponded to the female/motherly/Mut 
aspect of the creator. This is why many people still say say 
‚ÄúYisis‚Äù/‚ÄúYasis‚Äù as a reference to Jesus, because the letter 
‚ÄúJ‚Äù is a relatively recent addition (deception).
 The Osiris ‚Äúmyth‚Äù is essentially a story of how Osiris came 
to earth and was destined to die due to the corruption of 
Seth, scripture will tell you that we are all descendants of 
Seth since Noah is descended from Seth. So it is 
essentially a story of how god was on earth but due to the 
flaws of humanity he was destined to die, this is consistent 
with the narrative of Jesus especially the Gospel of Judas 
that was excluded by the Vatican. The symbolism the 
Egyptians used for Seth was often consistent with their 
symbolism for foreigners which makes sense considering 
scripture says it was the Roman Empire that killed Jesus.
 After the death of Osiris he is reborn as Chonsu, Chonsu is 
depicted essentially the same as Osiris except Chonsu has 
the Djed pillar in his hand which represents the new 
kingdom and has the sun on his head because he is the 
source of light, son=sun of god. This is also why Osiris and 
Chonsu are depicted with a crook and flail these are 
symbols of a shepherd because the Lord is our shepherd. 
This Djed is what becomes the early symbol of a cross with 
3 lines corresponding to what later becomes described as 
the ‚ÄúHoly Trinity‚Äù  which is arguably the oldest distortion of 
Christianity hence why all the different christianities have 
differing understandings of it, this is also why they literally 
removed the cross from their writing systems because then 
they wouldn‚Äôt be able to distort the truth of Chi. The temple 
of Chonsu is located in the Karnak Temple Complex which 
is intelligently designed so that the main corridor and 
‚Äúshrine‚Äù is illuminated perfectly by the rising sun during the 
mid-winter solstice in the northern hemisphere, the date of 
the mid winter solstice used to be December 25th on the 
Roman calendar i.e Christmas. The original holy trinity is 
the Theban Triad. Yah/Jah is from Egypt, because he 
represents the adult form of Chonsu.
 Early Christianity is found in Egypt, you can research the 
various ‚Äúgnostic‚Äù sects, prior to the roman Nicene creed  
that standardised christianity and you will see what different 
groups believed. The Nag Hammadi Library has a lot of 
valuable scripture that has a lot of truth found in 
Valentinianism and Sethian manuscripts. The people who 
wrote these manuscripts did not identify by labels such as 
‚ÄúValentinian‚Äù, ‚ÄúSethian‚Äù, ‚ÄúGnostic‚Äù, these are labels created 
to categorise beliefs that were excluded from the 
mainstream narrative.

<br><br>Islamic history says that the Jews believed Osiris was the son of god and the western narrative identifies the earliest Christians as being jews<br>
